# Troubleshoot

#### Toasts aren't rendering

Add the toast provider to a top-level position in your app. All consumers must be descendants of the provider. (see [Provider](/provider))

#### Toasts are ugly (missing styles, no close button, no icons)

If you're using the default components, make sure to pass `DefaultToastRoot` and `DefaultToastContent` into the `ToastProvider`. (see [Provider](/provider))
