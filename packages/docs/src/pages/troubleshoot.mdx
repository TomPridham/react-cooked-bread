#### Toasts aren't rendering

Add the toast provider to a top-level position in your app. All consumers must be descendants of the provider (see [Provider](/provider)).

#### Toasts are ugly (missing styles, no close button, no icons)

Make sure you have passed the required props to `ToastProvider`. If you'd like to use components provided by this library, you'll need to import components such as `SlideShrinkToastRoot` and `GlossyToastContent` to the `ToastProvider` (see [Provider](/provider) or [Quick Start](/quick-start)).
