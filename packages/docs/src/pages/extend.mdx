# Extend

## Components

Perhaps most commonly, you'll want to use your own component.

```tsx
<ToastProvider
  container={MySpecialOverlay}
  toastRoot={FancySlideAnimation}
  toastContent={OurCompanyMessageBox}
>
```

### Default Components

Discovering how the default components work can help you determine when and how to extend these components. We're working on additional default components for toast-root (animation wrapper) and toast-content (look and feel).

#### [ToastContainer](https://github.com/brettinternet/react-cooked-bread/blob/master/packages/react-cooked-bread/src/container.tsx)

This is always rendered by the [ToastProvider](/provider) and positions the toast according to the defined placement. There is a child `div` that is rendered by this wrapper which is from the `React-Transition-Group` parent.

#### [ToastRoot](https://github.com/brettinternet/react-cooked-bread/blob/master/packages/react-cooked-bread/src/toast-root/default.tsx)

[React-Trasition-Group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) animates the render of each toast and applies the styles to this element. For unique enter/exit styles, recreate this component and pass it to the `ToastProvider`.

#### [ToastContent](https://github.com/brettinternet/react-cooked-bread/blob/master/packages/react-cooked-bread/src/toast-content/default.tsx)

Custom React elements make up the stylized toast within this component: icons, buttons, text wrappers, the animated bar when `autoDismiss` is enabled.

## CSS

You may choose to use the default components and modify the default styles. Stylers are passed to the different styles props on the [ToastProvider](/provider): `containerStyles`, `transitionGroupStyles`, `toastStyles`.

### Stylers

This is the recommended way to custom styles for existing components.

> A `Styler` is an _object_ or a _function_ with prop arguments that returns an object.

#### Style object

With a `React.CSSProperties` style object:

```tsx
<ToastProvider
  containerStyles={{
    padding: '1rem'
  }}
  // toastStyles styler is unique because it styles multiple components
  toastStyles={{
    root: {
      backgroundColor: 'hotpink'
    },
    content: {
      color: 'dodgerblue'
    }
  }}
>
```

#### Style function

Or a function that receives an argument with props for that components, that returns a `React.CSSProperties` style object:

```tsx
<ToastProvider
  containerStyles={({ hasToasts }) => ({
    backgroundColor: hasToasts ? 'hotpink' : 'transparent'
  })}
  toastStyles={({ type, isRunning }) => ({
    root: {
      backgroundColor: type === 'error' ? 'tomato' : 'mediumseagreen'
    },
    counddown: {
      animationPlayState: isRunning ? 'running' : 'paused'
    }
  })}
  transitionGroupStyles={{
    display: 'flex',
    flexDirection: 'column-reverse',
  }}
>
```

Then, [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion) creates those styles into a CSS class assigned to the element.

### Classes

There are only two components rendered to the DOM. The first is the container that holds all the toasts in an absolute position over the viewport. Next is the toast component which is made up of just a few elements. Here they are:

```sass
.react-cooked-bread__container
  .react-cooked-bread__toast__transition-group
    .react-cooked-bread__toast__root
      .react-cooked-bread__toast__icon-wrapper
        .react-cooked-bread__toast__countdown
        .react-cooked-bread__toast__icon
      .react-cooked-bread__toast__content
      .react-cooked-bread__toast__dismiss-button
```
