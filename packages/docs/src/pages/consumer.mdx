# Consumer

With less boilerplate and succinct readability, the [hook](/hook) is the recommended way to consume the [Toast Context Props](/hook#props). If you're new to hooks, consider this [introduction to hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). The following consumption methods are considered aging patterns.

## Function as a Child

The [function as a child](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html#using-props-other-than-render) component `ToastConsumer` offers a way to use a render function as a children prop and make use of the [Context Props](/hook#props). Some may consider this method [an anti-pattern](https://americanexpress.io/faccs-are-an-antipattern/).

```tsx
import { ToastConsumer } from 'react-cooked-bread'

const Component = () => (
  <ToastConsumer>
    {(context) => context.toasts.map(({ id, content }) => <div key={id}>{content}</div>)}
  </ToastConsumer>
)
```

## Higher-Order Component

The higher-order component `withToastContext` provides `toastContext` as a [Context Props](/hook#props) object to your component.

```tsx
import { withToastContext, WithToastContextProps } from 'react-cooked-bread'

const Component: React.FC<WithToastContextProps> = ({ toastContext }) => {
  const { addToast } = toastContext

  // ...
}

const ComponentWithToast = withToastContext(Component)
```
