# Extend

Perhaps most commonly, you'll want to use your own component.

```js
<ToastProvider container={MySpecialOverlay} toast={MyCustomMessageBox}>
```

### Custom styles

You may also choose to use the default components and modify the default styles.

#### Classes

There are only two components rendered to the DOM. The first is the container that holds all the toasts in an absolute position over the viewport. Next is the toast component which is made up of just a few elements. Here they are:

```sass
.react-cooked-bread__container
  .react-cooked-bread__toast__transition-group
    .react-cooked-bread__toast__root
      .react-cooked-bread__toast__icon-wrapper
        .react-cooked-bread__toast__countdown
        .react-cooked-bread__toast__icon
      .react-cooked-bread__toast__content
      .react-cooked-bread__toast__dismiss-button
```
